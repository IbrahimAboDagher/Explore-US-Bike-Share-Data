# Explore-US-Bike-Share-Data
Udacity Professional Data Analysis NanoDegree - Project I

## Overview

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
## Software Used
To complete this project, the following softwares have been used:

> - Python , NumPy, and pandas.
> - A text editor (Atom).
> - A terminal application.
## The Datasets
>Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
>
> - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
> - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
> - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
> - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
> - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
> - User Type (Subscriber or Customer).
>
>The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
>
> - Gender
> - Birth Year
## Statistics Computed
I have learned about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.

In this project, I have wrote a code to provide the following information:

> 1- Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
>
> - most common month
> - most common day of week
> - most common hour of day
>
> 2- Popular stations and trip
>
> - most common start station
> - most common end station
> - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
>
> 3- Trip duration
>
> - total travel time
> - average travel time
>
> 4- User info
>
> - counts of each user type
> - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
> - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## The Interactive Experience
In this project, I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. 

The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change!

The below are screen shots taken from the project.
